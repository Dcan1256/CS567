#This chunk will take cvs file and initialize it in data frame than calculate the mean of each collum 
##Reading data

## initializing first and second collums of our dataframe into 2 vector called firstcollum and secondcollum
firstcollum <- data1[1]

## Creating the method for calculating the mean of the each collum

## results of first 2 collums
collummean(firstcollum)
